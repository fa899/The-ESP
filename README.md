## WARNING!
This script was made by Kiriot, and wasn't really made by me.
## Why is it forked?
Well, i don't know how to make Boxes ESP, or Chams ESP.
## How to use it?
First, we will Select it into a loadstring script.
local ESP = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fa899/The-ESP/main/ESP"))()
now, we will wan't to make a toggle, right?
So, type this:
ESP:Toggle(BoolOrState)
Alright! Now that we have that, we can now use our descendants.
ESP.Tracers = false
ESP.Names = false
ESP.Boxes = false
Very useful!
